# OpenSeed
Merging state-of-the-art decentralized databases (HIVE, IPFS, etc.) with "commodity" databases to create turnkey, cross-platform features like a shared user database, encrypted messaging, and more, making it easier than ever to bootstrap games and applications that leverage digital assets to engage users.

# **NOTE:** 

**This project is under heavy development and is currently being re-written using more modern methodologies for speed and security. Due to this re-write community contributions are hard to manage at the moment.**
